The game is the dino game the basis is that there are 5 objects the character(player), the terrain obstacles as follows cactus, cactuscluster 
and a bird with the gameplay being you needing to jump over the obstacles while also not jumping into the birds in the air while the game slowly 
speeds up over time with it being over if you hit any obstacle.
You the player are always technically in the same spot with the terrain moving towards you always with an increasing speed and the longer you 
can last the higher the score.
The game starts in a paused state.
The obstacles must always have a possible passable gap to jump over them while surviving.
The jump mechanic should be as follows: soft press(it by the time held) a short jump that should make it possible to jump over the cactuses and     
possibly the cactus clusters at a higher speed.
